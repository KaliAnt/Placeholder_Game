# S.T.E.V.E. - the Space Travel of the Extraordinary Valiant Entity  
Android game made in Unity.

### General idea
A character floating in the space represented by a circular body with a lot of eyes, having the primary ability to collect resources. We have other elements such as enemies, black holes and planets. The scope of the game is to gather resources and grow eyes so that you can see more resources you normally wouldn’t.

### Development
The game is developed in Unity2D 2018.1 and built for Android Phones.

### Character story
>You, Steve come from a distant planet. Everything was beautiful and gorgeous among the Stevenson until the big bad Gloreyez decided to come and destroy your planet. You and your fellow Stevensons fought bravely but that wasn’t enough and your sweet home was wiped off the face of the universe. You are the only survivor and you crave revenge as a diabetic craves insulin. Your ultimate and final goal is to destory all your enemies to achieve internal peace. You discovered that you can drastically improve yourself, by adding more eyes, and for this you must explore the universe and become so powerful that your enemies won’t have a chance to beat you. With the help of your team consisting of minions you’ll collect resources available on your path that’ll help you to upgrade, to better see more valuable resources and to “see more ways to kill your enemies”
